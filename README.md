# Mainframe Projects

Welcome to my **Mainframe Projects** repository! üöÄ This is where I showcase my skills and projects related to Mainframe technologies, including COBOL, JCL, and SQL. These scripts highlight my ability to work with legacy systems while building a strong foundation for enterprise applications.

## üìÇ Project Structure
This repository is organized into three main folders:
- **COBOL:** Programs demonstrating COBOL basics, file handling, and more.
- **JCL:** Scripts to execute and manage batch jobs.
- **SQL:** Queries for data manipulation and analysis.

## üìú Projects Overview

### COBOL
1. **File Processing with Sorting** (`sort_employees.cobol`):
   - A COBOL program that sorts employee data by salary and writes the sorted output to a new file. It demonstrates file handling and sorting techniques.

2. **Report Generator** (`employee_report.cobol`):
   - Generates a summary report of employees with salaries exceeding a specified threshold. It showcases conditional logic and report generation.

### JCL
1. **Conditional Execution** (`conditional_execution.jcl`):
   - Executes a COBOL program and conditionally runs a secondary step based on the success of the first step.

2. **VSAM File Management** (`vsam_file_management.jcl`):
   - Defines and loads a VSAM KSDS (Key-Sequenced Data Set) using IDCAMS, demonstrating dataset management.

### SQL
1. **Employee Data Insights** (`employee_data_insights.sql`):
   - Retrieves employees with salaries above their department average. Demonstrates subqueries and aggregation.

2. **Monthly Sales Report** (`monthly_sales_report.sql`):
   - Calculates total sales for each product category for the current month. Demonstrates grouping and aggregation.

## üõ†Ô∏è Skills Highlighted
- **COBOL:** Structured programming, file handling, and record processing.
- **JCL:** Batch job management, dataset handling, and execution.
- **SQL:** Data retrieval, filtering, aggregation, and reporting.
