# Mainframe Projects

Welcome to my **Mainframe Projects** repository! 🚀 This is where I showcase my skills and projects related to Mainframe technologies, including COBOL, JCL, and SQL. These scripts highlight my ability to work with legacy systems while building a strong foundation for enterprise applications.

## 📂 Project Structure
This repository is organized into three main folders:
- **COBOL:** Programs demonstrating COBOL basics, file handling, and more.
- **JCL:** Scripts to execute and manage batch jobs.
- **SQL:** Queries for data manipulation and analysis.

## 📜 Projects Overview
### COBOL
- **Hello World with File Handling:**  
  A COBOL program that writes "Hello, World!" to an output file. It showcases:
  - File handling
  - Writing to sequential files
  - COBOL syntax and structure

### JCL
- **Running a COBOL Program:**  
  A JCL script to execute the COBOL "Hello World" program. It demonstrates:
  - Job setup and execution
  - Dataset management
  - System output handling

### SQL
- **Simple Data Query:**  
  An SQL query that retrieves and sorts employee information from a sample database. It highlights:
  - Filtering with `WHERE` clauses
  - Sorting results with `ORDER BY`

## 🛠️ Skills Highlighted
- **COBOL:** Structured programming, file handling, and record processing.
- **JCL:** Batch job management, dataset handling, and execution.
- **SQL:** Data retrieval, filtering, and sorting.
